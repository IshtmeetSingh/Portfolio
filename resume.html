		Hello, I am Ishtmeet Singh, a 20 year old Web-Developer from Jammu, India. I have just started creating some real projects in web-development. I have 2 years of prior programming experience. I started off with FreeCodeCamp's curriculum. It gave me enough confidence to kick start my career in this field. I was quite satisfied with it. After that, I came to know about Codecademy, it's another interactive platform with a lots of courses, I started learning Javascript from there. I am doing pretty well, with over 2 months of practice, I've not made some real projects, but will try to make few more within next two months. I am quite motivated about this career path. I am in my second year of B. Tech (Engineering) course in Computer Science from a local engineering college. I will try to focus more on web-development rather than college's assignments. All I need is, an opportunity to work for someone.</i>

<h1>Topics I am good with- </h1>
<ul class="second-list">
	<li class="second-set"><a href="#html">HTML5</a></li>
	<li class="second-set"><a href="#css">CSS3</a></li>
	<li class="second-set"><a href="#javascript">Javascript</a></li>

</ul><br><br><br><br>
	<div id="html" class="languages">
		<b><u>HTML</u>:</b> I am quite strong in HTML. Very much familiar about the layout of a web page. I have all the basic knowledge about the all tags, elements and common practices. 
	</div>
	<div id ="css" class="languages">
	<b><u>CSS3</u>:</b> As, without CSS, the HTML pages would look quite awful, knowing CSS will give life to your web pages. I am very good with all the selectors, types and properties in CSS. Have been practicing CSS3 over six months now. I am trying to get better at it, with time. That would take some more time.
</div>
	<div id="javascript" class="languages">
		<b><u>Javascript</u>:</b> I have studied C++ before, so Javascript's basic topics like loops, conditional operators, functions, conditionals seem very easy to me and I have full control over those. I am still learning advanced topics of javascript. I am loving it and I think I am not good enough still, need to practice a lot.
</div>
<div id="jquery" class="languages">
	<b><u>jQuery</u>:</b> jQuery is one of the most amazing and intersting thing to interact with. We can do awesome, amazing and cool stuff with jQuery. I started loving it from the very first "On Click" event that I wrote. Everytime I get bored, I just get some cool things done using jQuery.
</div>
<div id="bootstrap" class="languages">
	<b><u>Bootstrap</u>:</b> Bootstrap, being a CSS library is awesome and get things done easily. It helps us to create responsive design that's really useful as there are a lot of mobile devices around the world. We can get that done using media queries in normal css, but Bootstrap provides us with more cool features like button fonts etc, and I know how to use it professionally. 
	</div>
	<div id="github" class="languages">
		<b><u>GitHub</u>:</b> I am not really much familiar with GitHub and how it should be used, but I know, it's used for storing our code safe and collaborating with other people around the globe and help them by contributing to their projects. It's really helpful, and will learn about it, when I feel like I need it.
